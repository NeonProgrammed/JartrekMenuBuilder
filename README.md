Finished with the profile's new event manager. Building admin panel's event manager now.
It shouldn't take long, the database can be tested using the test
user's login (user: test2; pass: test). Once the admin panel's event
manager is done the user manager can be tested by logging in with the admin's
credentials (user: test; pass: test).
