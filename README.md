Ran into some issues with how I initially processed requests for the database.
Currently patching in new event manager, but it's not done yet.
The graphics for the table will work, but for right now, the admin panel's
customer viewer has been disabled, the csv export has been disabled,
and tab changes on the table itself is disabled. Give me a day and it will be fixed.
